# .plan

### Last few successes
- Everything works, more or less
  - Output files are going into the right subfolders
  - Images are actually being minified
  - Browsersync opens and watches
    - No infinite loops when watching!
  - Published a Git project about it
  - Optimized gulpfile a little

### Next planned batch
##### General
- Arrange vendor libs within their own subfolders inside `src`. Easier for folks to add their own vendor libs and easier to maintain `LICENSE.md` to keep default inclusion legal and so forth.
  - Go back and fix Modernizr, Jquery, et al
  - The final boss version of this is to add them to the `package.json` and only put them in `htdocs` by copying from `/node_modules` YOU KNOW IT TO BE TRUE

##### Gulpfile
- Test image compression pipeline
  - JPG, GIF, animated GIF

##### HTML
- BrowserSync front-end code needs to be implemented
  - Setup and test synced browsing with mobile over LAN

### Full tasklist

##### General
- Use on a personal project by way of performing initial UAT pass
- Design and implement Gulp banner with ASCII mascot art

##### Gulpfile
- Make `gulp prod` command that:
  - uglifies/minifies JS and CSS
  - kills CSS maps
  - compresses images for output, not speed
- Wire `debug_mode` up to sass and js methods

##### HTML
- Finish thinking through what goes in `<head>`
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML
- Consider pages beyond index.html
  - Separate handling in terms of tooling, page setup, et al, for single-pagers vs. static sites?
  - (Beyond a certain point this becomes "the full-stack NodeJS version of this project" rather than "optional setup parameters", but it seems reasonable to provide an optimal starting point for both static sites and single-pagers.)
- Should explore partials as a way to keep chaff out of HTML working files (intra-`<head>` content; JS CDN includes; etc.)

##### Sass
- Optional opinionated framework
  - Light, CSS Grid-based, responsive-capable grid system
    - Adaptive grid breakpoints at 480, 768, 1024, 1366, 1920
  - Responsive typography defaults (research this more)
- Optional "set and forget" CSS file
  - https://github.com/kognise/water.css/blob/master/LICENSE.md

##### Media
- Image process needs one of:
  - Test dst dir for existence, make if not
  - Output to folder in `src` and move as part of series of move-only tasks (as opposed to piping output to `htdocs`)
- Determine default media types to support in project
(beyond images)
  - Determine their ideal folder hierarchy
- Add automated output for PageSpeed-ranking-increasing image formats
  - Add [Gif2WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/gif2webp) to the chain
  - Vet this [JPEG2000](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-jpeg-2000) Gulp package
  - Try getting progressive JPEG support with [MozJPEG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin-mozjpeg) rather than libjpeg-turbo
  - Vet other PNG compression options
- Responsive image Gulp pipeline ([example here](https://www.webstoemp.com/blog/responsive-images-pipeline-with-gulp/))
- Convert video to multiple web formats with [gulp-fluent-ffmpeg](https://github.com/psirenny/gulp-fluent-ffmpeg)
