# .plan

### Last few successes

##### General
- Fix licensing

##### HTML
- Should explore partials as a way to keep chaff out of HTML working files (intra-`<head>` content; JS CDN includes; etc.)

---

### Next planned batch
##### HTML
- Finish thinking through what goes in `<head>`
  - https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Introduction_to_HTML/The_head_metadata_in_HTML

##### Sass
- Optional opinionated framework
  - Light, CSS Grid-based, responsive-capable grid system
    - Adaptive grid breakpoints at 480, 768, 1024, 1366, 1920
  - Responsive typography defaults (research this more)

---

### Full tasklist

##### General

- Use on a personal project by way of performing initial UAT pass
- Design and implement Gulp banner with ASCII mascot art
- Manage common front-end libraries with `npm`
  - Pros:
    - It's an ethos, whereas currently we have none
    - Already using `npm` to manage CLI tooling and libs we want are largely already available there
    -
  - Cons:
    - No clear "best methodology" as of now
      - See https://blog.npmjs.org/post/101775448305/npm-and-front-end-packaging ("Hang In There" is literally a subtitle)
    - Obfuscatory to the user who hates CLI tooling but goes deep into FE debugging
  - Proposal:
    - User vars get moved to individual config file
      - One such var toggles the rest of the below on or off
    - CLI task is `npm start server` or some such
    - `npm` ingests config vars, performs `clean`, and copies front end vendor code to config-named `dst` dir
    - As callback, `npm` invokes the appropriate `gulp` command for the `npm` invocation used
      - `npm start build --prod` ends in `gulp build:prod`
      - `npm start server` ends in `gulp`
    - `gulp` then ingests our config file as well, and proceeds as normal

##### HTML

- Consider pages beyond index.html
  - Separate handling in terms of tooling, page setup, et al, for single-pagers vs. static sites?
  - (Beyond a certain point this becomes "the full-stack NodeJS version of this project" rather than "optional setup parameters", but it seems reasonable to provide an optimal starting point for both static sites and single-pagers.)

##### Sass
- Optional "set and forget" CSS file
  - https://github.com/kognise/water.css/blob/master/LICENSE.md

##### Media
- Determine default media types to support in project
(beyond images)
  - Here's one: Convert video to multiple web formats with [gulp-fluent-ffmpeg](https://github.com/psirenny/gulp-fluent-ffmpeg)
  - Determine their ideal folder hierarchy, pre-scaffold if needed
- Add automated output for PageSpeed-ranking-increasing image formats
  - Add [Gif2WebP](https://developers.google.com/speed/webp/docs/gif2webp) to the chain
  - Vet this [JPEG2000](https://www.npmjs.com/package/gulp-jpeg-2000) Gulp package
  - Try getting progressive JPEG support with [MozJPEG](https://www.npmjs.com/package/imagemin-mozjpeg) rather than libjpeg-turbo
- Responsive image Gulp pipeline ([example here](https://www.webstoemp.com/blog/responsive-images-pipeline-with-gulp/))
