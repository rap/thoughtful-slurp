# SASS Grid Framework TODO

##### Thoughts:
- It is in vogue, but bad practice, to:
  - Use custom HTML tags for grid structure
  - Use custom non-`data-` attributes for grid structure data
- Rather, it is not in vogue, but good practice, to:
  - Use BEM-style classes to bind grid functionality to HTML elements
  - Leverage grid templates to keep from having endless BEM-style grid classes
